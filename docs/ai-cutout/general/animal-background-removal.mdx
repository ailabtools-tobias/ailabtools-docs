## Application Scenarios

- **Pet photo album**: Home camera captures photos of pets (such as cats and dogs) playing at home, and then uses the algorithm to split the bokeh family clutter background to form a pet photo album.
- **Creative advertisement production**: the material taken by wild or captive animals is divided into animal images using the algorithm, and then combined with other materials to create an advertisement that fits the original idea.

## Featured Advantages

- **Exclusive scene capability**: for animal segmentation scenes, accurate segmentation of animal targets, and accurate segmentation of animal hair.
