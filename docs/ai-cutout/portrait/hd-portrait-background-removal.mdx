## Application Scenarios

- **Portrait Photography**: Human segmentation accurately isolates the subject from the background and applies background blur to simulate a large-aperture shallow-depth-of-field effect, making the person stand out more prominently.
- **ID Photo Creation**: By uploading or capturing a portrait photo, the system precisely segments the person and combines it with various background processing capabilities to generate a standardized ID photo.

## Featured Advantages

- **Strand-Level Fine Segmentation**: Achieves exceptionally high accuracy around edge details, precisely separating even individual hair strands. The resulting images appear natural and seamless, with no visible signs of processing.
- **Robust to Complex Backgrounds**: Accurately extracts the human subject even in scenes with cluttered or complex backgrounds.
- **Supports Multi-Person Images**: Handles single-person and multi-person images, complex scenes, and various human poses with high precision.
- **High-Resolution Image Support**: Capable of segmenting higher-resolution images, with file sizes supported up to 40 MB.
