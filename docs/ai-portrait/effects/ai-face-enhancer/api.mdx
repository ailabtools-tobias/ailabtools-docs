## Request

- **Method**: `POST`
- **Content-Type**: `multipart/form-data`

### Image requirements

- **Image format**: `JPEG` `JPG` `PNG` `BMP`
- **Image size**: No more than 3 MB.
- **Image resolution**: Larger than 32x32px, smaller than 2048x2048px (longest side less than or equal to 2047px), with a face occupying no less than 64x64px.
- The input image needs to contain faces.
- The number of faces in the input image should not exceed 10, otherwise only the first 10 faces with the largest area are processed.
