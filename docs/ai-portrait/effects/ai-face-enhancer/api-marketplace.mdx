## Request

### Image requirements

- **Image format**: `JPEG` `JPG` `PNG` `BMP`
- **Image size**: No more than 3 MB.
- **Image resolution**: Larger than 32x32px, smaller than 2048x2048px (longest side less than or equal to 2047px), with a face occupying no less than 64x64px.
- The input image needs to contain faces.
- The number of faces in the input image should not exceed 10, otherwise only the first 10 faces with the largest area are processed.
- The face in the input image should not have scratches, breaks, etc., and the algorithm does not support such repairs at this time.
- The quality of the faces in the input image should not be too sharp or too high in resolution, as this may lead to inverse quality degradation.
