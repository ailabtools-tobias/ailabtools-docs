title: "AILabTools API - Live Photos API"
description: "Based on face driving algorithm, it can turn the face in the image into dynamic effect. It can drive the five senses in the image to do specified actions (currently nodding and smiling) to make the face come alive, and the dynamic effects become dynamic to make the user's photo full of motion. The ability subsequently supports the generation of various kinds of dynamic and complex actions by specifying faces that meet the requirements, and can make long-time dynamic expressions. It can be used for online entertainment video generation, expression pack production, etc."
