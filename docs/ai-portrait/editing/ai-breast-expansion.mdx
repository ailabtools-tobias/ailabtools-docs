## Application Scenarios

- **Creator previews**: Generate ai breast expansion shots to visualize large breast size looks before a shoot or design sprint.
- **Marketing mockups**: Build ai boobs / ai boobies renderings to test campaign concepts without manual retouching.
- **A/B styling**: Quickly create boobs expansion variations—ai titties, ai tits, big tits ai—to learn what resonates.
- **Reference sets**: Produce pic of big boobs or pics big breast references for storyboards, thumbnails, and hero banners.

## Featured Advantages

- **Targeted expansion**: Focuses on the bust region so the rest of the portrait remains authentic.
- **Texture preservation**: Maintains lighting, fabric detail, and skin tone while scaling up the chest contour.
- **Async-ready**: Use `task_type=async` to queue multiple edits and fetch finished images via URL with minimal blocking.

## How It Works

1. Provide a `person_image` file that meets the basic size and format rules.
2. Submit the request with `task_type=async` to kick off boobs expansion in the background.
3. Retrieve the `image_url` result showing the ai breast expansion effect when processing finishes.
