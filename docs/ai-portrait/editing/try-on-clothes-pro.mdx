## FAQ

- **Why Is It Necessary to Upload a Flat Lay Image of the Garment?**
  A flat lay image clearly displays the garment’s structure and patterns, allowing the AI to better understand the garment’s relationship to the human body. This clarity helps the AI accurately simulate how the clothing will look when worn, resulting in a realistic try-on image.
- **What If I Don’t Have a Flat Lay Image of the Garment?**
  If a flat lay image isn’t available, you can photograph the garment on a colleague or friend in a well-lit area, or place it on a mannequin for a clear shot. Both methods will provide the AI with sufficient visual details for optimal processing.
- **Why Does the Generated Image Lack Detail and Texture?**
  For high-quality results, it’s essential to use a high-resolution, complete flat lay image. Missing details or incomplete angles in the uploaded image may lead the AI to fill in gaps, which can result in an outcome that doesn’t match the desired look.
- **How to Choose the Right Model Image?**
  Select a clear, unobstructed full-body or half-body image of the model from the front. For best results, choose an image with minimal clothing (e.g., shorts and a T-shirt) so that both arms and legs are clearly visible. Avoid model photos with long skirts, layered clothing, oversized sleeves, or accessories like scarves, umbrellas, or bags, as these can interfere with the try-on rendering.
