## Application Scenarios

- **Massive image optimization**: It can be used to improve the image quality of website pictures, cell phone album pictures, and video extraction frames, to intelligently denoise pictures that become blurred after compression, to strengthen the image texture details, and to make the image picture clearer.
- **Video Surveillance**: In security surveillance/vehicle system scenarios, improve image clarity and reconstruct the picture for more discernible surveillance material.
