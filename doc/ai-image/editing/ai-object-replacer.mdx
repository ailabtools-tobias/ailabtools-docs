description: "Leveraging advanced AI technology, this API intelligently removes unwanted elements such as text and people from images based on a mask image and fills the empty space with appropriate content generated from user prompts."
---

## Application Scenarios

- **Logo erasure**: Erase common logos in images, such as logos, text, subtitles, etc., which can be used for image material re-creation.
- **Portrait Erase**: Erase extra portraits in the image, such as background portraits of passers-by, pedestrians, etc., in addition to the main character, to highlight the subject of the photo.
- **Clutter Erase**: Erase excess objects from the image, such as trash cans, buildings, or power lines, and retain the original photo resolution.
- **Other scenes**: applicable to other elements erasure, automatically fill the background obscured by the erased area, the effect is real and natural

## Featured Advantages

- **Strong R&D strength**: We have an independent AI R&D team, supported by massive data, rich algorithm landing scenarios, and long-term partnership with many brands.
- **Efficient and convenient**: The API solution is mature, with standardized documentation & full technical support, making it easier for developers to access and enjoy image processing services quickly.
