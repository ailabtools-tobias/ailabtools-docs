  Dear Developers,

  We are thrilled to announce that our API is receiving a major update! The new version will introduce a host of improvements and feature enhancements to enhance your development experience and meet your needs.

  However, along with the rollout of the new version, we must also inform you that the old version of the API will no longer receive maintenance and support. This means that we will no longer release new features, fix known issues, or provide technical support for the old version of the API.

  We strongly encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of the API as soon as possible to ensure that your applications continue to operate smoothly and to take advantage of the latest features and optimizations.

  If you have any questions or need assistance regarding this change, please feel free to contact our support team [(support@ailabtools.com)](mailto:support@ailabtools.com). We are committed to assisting you and ensuring a smooth transition.
